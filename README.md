The assignment is to create a jobfinder web app, in which both companies and candidates can setup their profiles.
Companies can also publish and manage their job advertisements, while candidates can create and publish multiple instances or their CVs, to be sent to answer said advertisements.
There are many filtering functions and options to correlate in the best way possible both candidates and companies.
